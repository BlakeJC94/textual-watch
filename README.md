# Textual Watch
---
Widget for Textual Framework that emulates the `watch` shell command

This is an offshoot from a side-project where I needed to build a quick TUI using the
[Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual) library to pipe output from several shell commands
into a few widgets in the terminal.

Suggestions and feedback is welcome here, feel free to open a PR or raise an issue for further
discussion.
